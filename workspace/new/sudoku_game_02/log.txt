## Requirement Analysis:
The product should be a Sudoku game implemented using the pygame library. It should have a user-friendly interface that allows players to start a new game, choose the difficulty level, input numbers into the Sudoku grid, receive feedback on correctness, pause and resume the game, receive hints or suggestions, and check their progress. The game should also provide various difficulty levels to cater to different skill levels of players.

## Requirement Pool:
```python
[
    ("Implement the Sudoku grid and user interface", "P0"),
    ("Allow players to start a new game and choose the difficulty level", "P0"),
    ("Implement input functionality for players to fill numbers into the grid", "P0"),
    ("Provide feedback on the correctness of the filled numbers", "P0"),
    ("Implement pause and resume functionality", "P1")
]
```

## UI Design draft:
The UI design should include the following elements and functions:
- Sudoku grid: A 9x9 grid where players can input numbers.
- Difficulty selection: A dropdown menu or buttons to allow players to choose the difficulty level.
- New game button: A button to start a new game.
- Pause button: A button to pause the game.
- Resume button: A button to resume the game.
- Hint button: A button to provide hints or suggestions to the player.
- Check button: A button to check the correctness of the filled numbers.
- Progress display: A display to show the number of correctly filled cells.

The style of the UI should be clean and minimalistic, with easy-to-read numbers and clear buttons. The layout should be intuitive and organized, with the Sudoku grid taking the central focus and the other elements placed around it for easy access.

## Anything UNCLEAR:
There are no unclear points.

We will use the pygame library to implement the Sudoku game. Pygame is a popular open-source library for game development in Python, providing functionality for graphics, sound, and user input. It is widely used and has a large community, making it a good choice for our project. We will also make use of other open-source tools and libraries to enhance the functionality and usability of the game.

"""
The 'utils.py' file contains the 'generate_sudoku' function, which is used to generate a new Sudoku grid based on the specified difficulty level.

The 'grid.py' file contains the 'SudokuGrid' class, which represents the Sudoku grid and provides methods for setting and getting cell values, checking the validity of moves, and checking if the grid is complete.

The 'ui.py' file contains the 'SudokuUI' class, which handles the user interface of the game, including drawing the grid, handling user input, and displaying hints and progress.

The 'solver.py' file contains the 'SudokuSolver' class, which is responsible for solving the Sudoku grid using a backtracking algorithm.

The 'sudoku.py' file contains the 'SudokuGame' class, which manages the overall game flow, including starting a new game, handling user input, pausing and resuming the game, and checking the progress.

The 'main.py' file is the entry point of the program and is responsible for creating an instance of the 'SudokuGame' class and starting the game.

It should have a user-friendly interface that allows players to start a new game, choose the difficulty level, input numbers into the Sudoku grid, receive feedback on correctness, pause and resume the game, receive hints or suggestions, and check their progress. The game should also provide various difficulty levels to cater to different skill levels of players.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n```python\n[\n    ("Implement the Sudoku grid and user interface", "P0"),\n    ("Allow players to start a new game and choose the difficulty level", "P0"),\n    ("Implement input functionality for players to fill numbers into the grid", "P0"),\n    ("Provide feedback on the correctness of the filled numbers", "P0"),\n    ("Implement pause and resume functionality", "P1")\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe UI design should include the following elements and functions:\n- Sudoku grid: A 9x9 grid where players can input numbers.\n- Difficulty selection: A dropdown menu or buttons to allow players to choose the difficulty level.\n- New game button: A button to start a new game.\n- Pause button: A button to pause the game.\n- Resume button: A button to resume the game.\n- Hint button: A button to provide hints or suggestions to the player.\n- Check button: A button to check the correctness of the filled numbers.\n- Progress display: A display to show the number of correctly filled cells.\n\nThe style of the UI should be clean and minimalistic, with easy-to-read numbers and clear buttons. The layout should be intuitive and organized, with the Sudoku grid taking the central focus and the other elements placed around it for easy access.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach:\nWe will use the pygame library to implement the Sudoku game. Pygame is a popular open-source library for game development in Python, providing functionality for graphics, sound, and user input. It is widely used and has a large community, making it a good choice for our project. We will also make use of other open-source tools and libraries to enhance the functionality and usability of the game.\n\n## Python package name:\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File list:\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n    "sudoku.py",\n    "grid.py",\n    "ui.py",\n    "solver.py",\n    "utils.py"\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions:\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class SudokuGame{\n        +start_new_game(difficulty: str) -> None\n        +input_number(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +pause_game() -> None\n        +resume_game() -> None\n        +get_hint() -> Tuple[int, int, int]\n        +check_progress() -> int\n    }\n    class SudokuGrid{\n        +__init__() -> None\n        +get_cell(row: int, col: int) -> int\n        +set_cell(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +is_valid_move(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> bool\n        +is_complete() -> bool\n    }\n    class SudokuUI{\n        +__init__(grid: SudokuGrid) -> None\n        +draw() -> None\n        +handle_input() -> None\n        +show_hint(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +show_progress(correct_cells: int) -> None\n    }\n    class SudokuSolver{\n        +__init__(grid: SudokuGrid) -> None\n        +solve() -> bool\n        +get_solution() -> SudokuGrid\n    }\n    class Utils{\n        +generate_sudoku(difficulty: str) -> SudokuGrid\n    }\n    SudokuGame "1" -- "1" SudokuGrid: has\n    SudokuGame "1" -- "1" SudokuUI: has\n    SudokuGame "1" -- "1" SudokuSolver: has\n    SudokuGrid "1" -- "1" SudokuSolver: uses\n    SudokuUI "1" -- "1" SudokuGrid: uses\n    SudokuSolver "1" -- "1" SudokuGrid: uses\n    SudokuSolver "1" -- "1" Utils: uses\n```\n\n## Program call flow:\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Main as Main\n    participant Game as SudokuGame\n    participant Grid as SudokuGrid\n    participant UI as SudokuUI\n    participant Solver as SudokuSolver\n    participant Utils as Utils\n    Main->>Game: start_new_game(difficulty)\n    Game->>Grid: __init__()\n    Game->>UI: __init__(grid)\n    Main->>UI: draw()\n    Main->>UI: handle_input()\n    UI->>Game: input_number(row, col, number)\n    Game->>Grid: set_cell(row, col, number)\n    Grid->>Grid: is_valid_move(row, col, number)\n    Grid->>Grid: is_complete()\n    Game->>UI: show_hint(row, col, number)\n    Game->>UI: show_progress(correct_cells)\n    Main->>Game: pause_game()\n    Main->>Game: resume_game()\n    Solver->>Solver: __init__(grid)\n    Solver->>Solver: solve()\n    Solver->>Solver: get_solution()\n    Utils->>Utils: generate_sudoku(difficulty)\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR:\nThe requirements are clear to me., Project Manager: ## Required Python third-party packages:\n\n```python\n"""\npygame==2.0.1\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages:\n\n```python\n"""\nNo other language third-party packages required.\n"""\n```\n\n## Dockerfile:\n\n```python\n"""\nFROM python:3.9.5-slim-buster\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY . /app\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\nCMD ["python", "main.py"]\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec:\n\n```python\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: Sudoku Game API\n  description: API for playing Sudoku game\n  version: 1.0.0\nservers:\n  -

It should have a user-friendly interface that allows players to start a new game, choose the difficulty level, input numbers into the Sudoku grid, receive feedback on correctness, pause and resume the game, receive hints or suggestions, and check their progress. The game should also provide various difficulty levels to cater to different skill levels of players.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n```python\n[\n    ("Implement the Sudoku grid and user interface", "P0"),\n    ("Allow players to start a new game and choose the difficulty level", "P0"),\n    ("Implement input functionality for players to fill numbers into the grid", "P0"),\n    ("Provide feedback on the correctness of the filled numbers", "P0"),\n    ("Implement pause and resume functionality", "P1")\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe UI design should include the following elements and functions:\n- Sudoku grid: A 9x9 grid where players can input numbers.\n- Difficulty selection: A dropdown menu or buttons to allow players to choose the difficulty level.\n- New game button: A button to start a new game.\n- Pause button: A button to pause the game.\n- Resume button: A button to resume the game.\n- Hint button: A button to provide hints or suggestions to the player.\n- Check button: A button to check the correctness of the filled numbers.\n- Progress display: A display to show the number of correctly filled cells.\n\nThe style of the UI should be clean and minimalistic, with easy-to-read numbers and clear buttons. The layout should be intuitive and organized, with the Sudoku grid taking the central focus and the other elements placed around it for easy access.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach:\nWe will use the pygame library to implement the Sudoku game. Pygame is a popular open-source library for game development in Python, providing functionality for graphics, sound, and user input. It is widely used and has a large community, making it a good choice for our project. We will also make use of other open-source tools and libraries to enhance the functionality and usability of the game.\n\n## Python package name:\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File list:\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n    "sudoku.py",\n    "grid.py",\n    "ui.py",\n    "solver.py",\n    "utils.py"\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions:\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class SudokuGame{\n        +start_new_game(difficulty: str) -> None\n        +input_number(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +pause_game() -> None\n        +resume_game() -> None\n        +get_hint() -> Tuple[int, int, int]\n        +check_progress() -> int\n    }\n    class SudokuGrid{\n        +__init__() -> None\n        +get_cell(row: int, col: int) -> int\n        +set_cell(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +is_valid_move(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> bool\n        +is_complete() -> bool\n    }\n    class SudokuUI{\n        +__init__(grid: SudokuGrid) -> None\n        +draw() -> None\n        +handle_input() -> None\n        +show_hint(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +show_progress(correct_cells: int) -> None\n    }\n    class SudokuSolver{\n        +__init__(grid: SudokuGrid) -> None\n        +solve() -> bool\n        +get_solution() -> SudokuGrid\n    }\n    class Utils{\n        +generate_sudoku(difficulty: str) -> SudokuGrid\n    }\n    SudokuGame "1" -- "1" SudokuGrid: has\n    SudokuGame "1" -- "1" SudokuUI: has\n    SudokuGame "1" -- "1" SudokuSolver: has\n    SudokuGrid "1" -- "1" SudokuSolver: uses\n    SudokuUI "1" -- "1" SudokuGrid: uses\n    SudokuSolver "1" -- "1" SudokuGrid: uses\n    SudokuSolver "1" -- "1" Utils: uses\n```\n\n## Program call flow:\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Main as Main\n    participant Game as SudokuGame\n    participant Grid as SudokuGrid\n    participant UI as SudokuUI\n    participant Solver as SudokuSolver\n    participant Utils as Utils\n    Main->>Game: start_new_game(difficulty)\n    Game->>Grid: __init__()\n    Game->>UI: __init__(grid)\n    Main->>UI: draw()\n    Main->>UI: handle_input()\n    UI->>Game: input_number(row, col, number)\n    Game->>Grid: set_cell(row, col, number)\n    Grid->>Grid: is_valid_move(row, col, number)\n    Grid->>Grid: is_complete()\n    Game->>UI: show_hint(row, col, number)\n    Game->>UI: show_progress(correct_cells)\n    Main->>Game: pause_game()\n    Main->>Game: resume_game()\n    Solver->>Solver: __init__(grid)\n    Solver->>Solver: solve()\n    Solver->>Solver: get_solution()\n    Utils->>Utils: generate_sudoku(difficulty)\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR:\nThe requirements are clear to me., Project Manager: ## Required Python third-party packages:\n\n```python\n"""\npygame==2.0.1\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages:\n\n```python\n"""\nNo other language third-party packages required.\n"""\n```\n\n## Dockerfile:\n\n```python\n"""\nFROM python:3.9.5-slim-buster\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY . /app\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\nCMD ["python", "main.py"]\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec:\n\n```python\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: Sudoku Game API\n  description: API for playing Sudoku game\n  version: 1.0.0\nservers:\n  -

It should have a user-friendly interface that allows players to start a new game, choose the difficulty level, input numbers into the Sudoku grid, receive feedback on correctness, pause and resume the game, receive hints or suggestions, and check their progress. The game should also provide various difficulty levels to cater to different skill levels of players.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n```python\n[\n    ("Implement the Sudoku grid and user interface", "P0"),\n    ("Allow players to start a new game and choose the difficulty level", "P0"),\n    ("Implement input functionality for players to fill numbers into the grid", "P0"),\n    ("Provide feedback on the correctness of the filled numbers", "P0"),\n    ("Implement pause and resume functionality", "P1")\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe UI design should include the following elements and functions:\n- Sudoku grid: A 9x9 grid where players can input numbers.\n- Difficulty selection: A dropdown menu or buttons to allow players to choose the difficulty level.\n- New game button: A button to start a new game.\n- Pause button: A button to pause the game.\n- Resume button: A button to resume the game.\n- Hint button: A button to provide hints or suggestions to the player.\n- Check button: A button to check the correctness of the filled numbers.\n- Progress display: A display to show the number of correctly filled cells.\n\nThe style of the UI should be clean and minimalistic, with easy-to-read numbers and clear buttons. The layout should be intuitive and organized, with the Sudoku grid taking the central focus and the other elements placed around it for easy access.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach:\nWe will use the pygame library to implement the Sudoku game. Pygame is a popular open-source library for game development in Python, providing functionality for graphics, sound, and user input. It is widely used and has a large community, making it a good choice for our project. We will also make use of other open-source tools and libraries to enhance the functionality and usability of the game.\n\n## Python package name:\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File

It should have a user-friendly interface that allows players to start a new game, choose the difficulty level, input numbers into the Sudoku grid, receive feedback on correctness, pause and resume the game, receive hints or suggestions, and check their progress. The game should also provide various difficulty levels to cater to different skill levels of players.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n```python\n[\n    ("Implement the Sudoku grid and user interface", "P0"),\n    ("Allow players to start a new game and choose the difficulty level", "P0"),\n    ("Implement input functionality for players to fill numbers into the grid", "P0"),\n    ("Provide feedback on the correctness of the filled numbers", "P0"),\n    ("Implement pause and resume functionality", "P1")\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe UI design should include the following elements and functions:\n- Sudoku grid: A 9x9 grid where players can input numbers.\n- Difficulty selection: A dropdown menu or buttons to allow players to choose the difficulty level.\n- New game button: A button to start a new game.\n- Pause button: A button to pause the game.\n- Resume button: A button to resume the game.\n- Hint button: A button to provide hints or suggestions to the player.\n- Check button: A button to check the correctness of the filled numbers.\n- Progress display: A display to show the number of correctly filled cells.\n\nThe style of the UI should be clean and minimalistic, with easy-to-read numbers and clear buttons. The layout should be intuitive and organized, with the Sudoku grid taking the central focus and the other elements placed around it for easy access.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach:\nWe will use the pygame library to implement the Sudoku game. Pygame is a popular open-source library for game development in Python, providing functionality for graphics, sound, and user input. It is widely used and has a large community, making it a good choice for our project. We will also make use of other open-source tools and libraries to enhance the functionality and usability of the game.\n\n## Python package name:\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File

It should have a user-friendly interface that allows players to start a new game, choose the difficulty level, input numbers into the Sudoku grid, receive feedback on correctness, pause and resume the game, receive hints or suggestions, and check their progress. The game should also provide various difficulty levels to cater to different skill levels of players.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n```python\n[\n    ("Implement the Sudoku grid and user interface", "P0"),\n    ("Allow players to start a new game and choose the difficulty level", "P0"),\n    ("Implement input functionality for players to fill numbers into the grid", "P0"),\n    ("Provide feedback on the correctness of the filled numbers", "P0"),\n    ("Implement pause and resume functionality", "P1")\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe UI design should include the following elements and functions:\n- Sudoku grid: A 9x9 grid where players can input numbers.\n- Difficulty selection: A dropdown menu or buttons to allow players to choose the difficulty level.\n- New game button: A button to start a new game.\n- Pause button: A button to pause the game.\n- Resume button: A button to resume the game.\n- Hint button: A button to provide hints or suggestions to the player.\n- Check button: A button to check the correctness of the filled numbers.\n- Progress display: A display to show the number of correctly filled cells.\n\nThe style of the UI should be clean and minimalistic, with easy-to-read numbers and clear buttons. The layout should be intuitive and organized, with the Sudoku grid taking the central focus and the other elements placed around it for easy access.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach:\nWe will use the pygame library to implement the Sudoku game. Pygame is a popular open-source library for game development in Python, providing functionality for graphics, sound, and user input. It is widely used and has a large community, making it a good choice for our project. We will also make use of other open-source tools and libraries to enhance the functionality and usability of the game.\n\n## Python package name:\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File

It should have a user-friendly interface that allows players to start a new game, choose the difficulty level, input numbers into the Sudoku grid, receive feedback on correctness, pause and resume the game, receive hints or suggestions, and check their progress. The game should also provide various difficulty levels to cater to different skill levels of players.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n```python\n[\n    ("Implement the Sudoku grid and user interface", "P0"),\n    ("Allow players to start a new game and choose the difficulty level", "P0"),\n    ("Implement input functionality for players to fill numbers into the grid", "P0"),\n    ("Provide feedback on the correctness of the filled numbers", "P0"),\n    ("Implement pause and resume functionality", "P1")\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe UI design should include the following elements and functions:\n- Sudoku grid: A 9x9 grid where players can input numbers.\n- Difficulty selection: A dropdown menu or buttons to allow players to choose the difficulty level.\n- New game button: A button to start a new game.\n- Pause button: A button to pause the game.\n- Resume button: A button to resume the game.\n- Hint button: A button to provide hints or suggestions to the player.\n- Check button: A button to check the correctness of the filled numbers.\n- Progress display: A display to show the number of correctly filled cells.\n\nThe style of the UI should be clean and minimalistic, with easy-to-read numbers and clear buttons. The layout should be intuitive and organized, with the Sudoku grid taking the central focus and the other elements placed around it for easy access.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach:\nWe will use the pygame library to implement the Sudoku game. Pygame is a popular open-source library for game development in Python, providing functionality for graphics, sound, and user input. It is widely used and has a large community, making it a good choice for our project. We will also make use of other open-source tools and libraries to enhance the functionality and usability of the game.\n\n## Python package name:\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File

contains the \'generate_sudoku\' function, which is used to generate a new Sudoku grid based on the specified difficulty level.\n\nThe \'grid.py\' file contains the \'SudokuGrid\' class, which represents the Sudoku grid and provides methods for setting and getting cell values, checking the validity of moves, and checking if the grid is complete.\n\nThe \'ui.py\' file contains the \'SudokuUI\' class, which handles the user interface of the game, including drawing the grid, handling user input, and displaying hints and progress.\n\nThe \'solver.py\' file contains the \'SudokuSolver\' class, which is responsible for solving the Sudoku grid using a backtracking algorithm.\n\nThe \'sudoku.py\' file contains the \'SudokuGame\' class, which manages the overall game flow, including starting a new game, handling user input, pausing and resuming the game, and checking the progress.\n\nThe \'main.py\' file is the entry point of the program and is responsible for creating an instance of the \'SudokuGame\' class and starting the game.\n"""\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR:\n\nNo unclear requirements., Engineer: import pygame\nfrom sudoku import SudokuGame\nfrom ui
