## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the entry point of the program"),
    ("sudoku.py", "Contains the SudokuGame class for managing the game"),
    ("grid.py", "Contains the SudokuGrid class for managing the Sudoku grid"),
    ("ui.py", "Contains the SudokuUI class for handling the user interface"),
    ("solver.py", "Contains the SudokuSolver class for solving the Sudoku grid"),
    ("utils.py", "Contains utility functions for generating Sudoku grids")

## Task list:

```python
[

    "ui.py",
    "solver.py",
    "utils.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge:

```python
"""
The 'utils.py' file contains the 'generate_sudoku' function, which is used to generate a new Sudoku grid based on the specified difficulty level.

The 'grid.py' file contains the 'SudokuGrid' class, which represents the Sudoku grid and provides methods for setting and getting cell values, checking the validity of moves, and checking if the grid is complete.

The 'ui.py' file contains the 'SudokuUI' class, which handles the user interface of the game, including drawing the grid, handling user input, and displaying hints and progress.

The 'solver.py' file contains the 'SudokuSolver' class, which is responsible for solving the Sudoku grid using a backtracking algorithm.

The 'sudoku.py' file contains the 'SudokuGame' class, which manages the overall game flow, including starting a new game, handling user input, pausing and resuming the game, and checking the progress.

The 'main.py' file is the entry point of the program and is responsible for creating an instance of the 'SudokuGame' class and starting the game.
