2023-09-02 12:19:42.401 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:58 - ## Implementation approach:
For the implementation of the Sudoku game, we will use the following open-source tools:
- Pygame: A popular library for building interactive games and multimedia applications in Python.
- Pygame_gui: A GUI library for Pygame that provides a set of user interface elements and tools for creating graphical user interfaces.
- Numpy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

    ("game.py", "Contains the Game class for managing the game logic"),
    ("grid.py", "Contains the Grid class for managing the Sudoku grid"),

## Task list:

```

## Shared Knowledge:
```python
"""
The 'game.py' file contains the Game class, which is responsible for managing the game logic. It has methods for starting a new game, checking the game progress, getting a hint, saving the game, and loading a saved game.

The 'grid.py' file contains the Grid class, which represents the Sudoku grid. It has methods for setting and getting cell values, checking if a move is valid, and checking if the grid is complete.

The 'solver.py' file contains the Solver class, which is responsible for solving Sudoku puzzles. It has a solve() method that takes a grid as input and returns True if the puzzle is solvable, and False otherwise.

The 'ui.py' file contains the UI class, which is responsible for rendering the game interface using Pygame and Pygame_gui. It has methods for drawing the grid, cells, and messages, as well as getting user input.

The main.py file is the entry point of the game. It initializes the Game, Grid, Solver, and UI objects, and handles the game flow by calling the appropriate methods.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR:
We need more details on how the game flow should be implemented and how the UI should interact with the game logic.

It should have a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls. The game should provide various difficulty levels and allow players to save and load their progress. Additionally, the game should have a hint feature to assist players when they are stuck.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n```python\n[\n    ("Implement a new game button", "P0"),\n    ("Allow players to input numbers into the Sudoku grid", "P0"),\n    ("Implement a progress check feature", "P1"),\n    ("Implement a hint feature", "P1"),\n    ("Allow players to save and load game progress", "P2")\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe Sudoku game will have a clean and minimalistic design. The main screen will display the Sudoku grid with empty cells for players to fill in.
