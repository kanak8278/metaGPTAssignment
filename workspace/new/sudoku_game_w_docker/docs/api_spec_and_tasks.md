## Logic Analysis:
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Main entry point of the game"),
    ("game.py", "Contains the Game class for managing the game logic"),
    ("grid.py", "Contains the Grid class for managing the Sudoku grid"),
    ("solver.py", "Contains the Solver class for solving Sudoku puzzles"),
    ("ui.py", "Contains the UI class for rendering the game interface")
]
```

## Task list:
```python
[
    "game.py",
    "grid.py",
    "solver.py",
    "ui.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge:
```python
"""
The 'game.py' file contains the Game class, which is responsible for managing the game logic. It has methods for starting a new game, checking the game progress, getting a hint, saving the game, and loading a saved game.

The 'grid.py' file contains the Grid class, which represents the Sudoku grid. It has methods for setting and getting cell values, checking if a move is valid, and checking if the grid is complete.

The 'solver.py' file contains the Solver class, which is responsible for solving Sudoku puzzles. It has a solve() method that takes a grid as input and returns True if the puzzle is solvable, and False otherwise.

The 'ui.py' file contains the UI class, which is responsible for rendering the game interface using Pygame and Pygame_gui. It has methods for drawing the grid, cells, and messages, as well as getting user input.

The main.py file is the entry point of the game. It initializes the Game, Grid, Solver, and UI objects, and handles the game flow by calling the appropriate methods.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR:
We need more details on how the game flow should be implemented and how the UI should interact with the game logic.
