## Implementation approach:
For the implementation of the Sudoku game, we will use the following open-source tools:
- Pygame: A popular library for building interactive games and multimedia applications in Python.
- Pygame_gui: A GUI library for Pygame that provides a set of user interface elements and tools for creating graphical user interfaces.
- Numpy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Python package name:
```python
"sudoku_game"
```

## File list:
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "grid.py",
    "solver.py",
    "ui.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions:
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Game{
        +start_new_game(difficulty: str) -> None
        +check_progress() -> bool
        +get_hint() -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]
        +save_game() -> None
        +load_game() -> None
    }
    class Grid{
        +set_cell_value(row: int, col: int, value: int) -> None
        +get_cell_value(row: int, col: int) -> int
        +is_valid_move(row: int, col: int, value: int) -> bool
        +is_complete() -> bool
    }
    class Solver{
        +solve(grid: Grid) -> bool
    }
    class UI{
        +draw_grid(grid: Grid) -> None
        +draw_cell(row: int, col: int, value: int) -> None
        +highlight_cell(row: int, col: int) -> None
        +get_input() -> Tuple[int, int, int]
        +show_message(message: str) -> None
    }
    Game "1" -- "1" Grid: has
    Game "1" -- "1" Solver: has
    Game "1" -- "1" UI: has
    Grid "1" -- "1" UI: has
    Solver "1" -- "1" Grid: uses
    UI "1" -- "1" Grid: uses
    UI "1" -- "1" Solver: uses
```

## Program call flow:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant U as UI
    participant S as Solver
    participant D as Data

    M->>G: start_new_game(difficulty)
    G->>U: draw_grid(grid)
    U->>U: draw_cell(row, col, value) for each cell in grid
    M->>U: get_input()
    U->>G: set_cell_value(row, col, value)
    G->>G: is_valid_move(row, col, value)
    G->>U: highlight_cell(row, col)
    G->>G: is_complete()
    G->>U: show_message("Game complete!")
    G->>G: check_progress()
    G->>U: show_message("Progress: X%")
    G->>G: get_hint()
    G->>U: highlight_cell(row, col)
    M->>G: save_game()
    D->>G: save_game_data()
    M->>G: load_game()
    D->>G: load_game_data()
    G->>U: draw_grid(grid)
```

The requirements are clear to me.
