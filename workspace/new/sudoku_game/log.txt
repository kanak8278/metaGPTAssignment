2023-08-30 09:50:52.598 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:58 - ## Implementation approach
For implementing the sudoku game using pygame, we will use the following open-source tools:

1. Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.

2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.

3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.

4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.

5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality. We can use it to display text elements such as hints, messages, and scores in the game.

By using these open-source tools, we can leverage the existing functionality and resources available in the community to build a robust and feature-rich sudoku game.

Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.\n\n2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.\n\n5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality. We can use it to display text elements such as hints, messages, and scores in the game.\n\nBy using these open-source tools, we can leverage the existing functionality and resources available in the community to build a robust and feature-rich sudoku game.\n\n## Python package name\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n    "game.py",\n    "grid.py",\n    "cell.py",\n    "solver.py",\n    "menu.py",\n    "text.py",\n    "assets/",\n    "fonts/",\n    "images/"\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Game{\n        -int score\n        -int time\n        -Grid grid\n        -Solver solver\n        +start_new_game(difficulty: str) -> None\n        +input_number(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +check_solution() -> bool\n        +get_hint() -> Tuple[int, int, int]\n        +change_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Grid{\n        -List[List[Cell]] cells\n        +get_cell(row: int, col: int) -> Cell\n        +is_valid_move(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> bool\n        +is_complete() -> bool\n    }\n    class Cell{\n        -int value\n        -bool editable\n        +get_value() -> int\n        +set_value(value: int) -> None\n        +is_editable() -> bool\n    }\n    class Solver{\n        -Grid grid\n        +solve() -> bool\n    }\n    class Menu{\n        -List[str] difficulty_levels\n        +get_difficulty_levels() -> List[str]\n        +set_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Text{\n        -str text\n        -int size\n        -str color\n        -str font\n        +render() -> pygame.Surface\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "1" Grid: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Solver: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Menu: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Text: has\n    Grid "1" -- "*" Cell: contains\n    Menu "1" -- "*" Text: contains\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant GD as Grid\n    participant C as Cell\n    participant S as Solver\n    participant MN as Menu\n    participant T as Text\n    ...\n    M->>G: start new game\n    G->>MN: get difficulty levels\n    MN->>M: return difficulty levels\n    M->>G: set difficulty\n    G->>GD: create grid\n    GD->>C: create cells\n    G->>S: create solver\n    M->>G: input number\n    G->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: set value\n    M->>G: check solution\n    G->>GD: is complete\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: get hint\n    G->>S: solve\n    S->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: change difficulty\n    G->>MN: set difficulty\n    M->>G: end game\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirements are clear to me.]\n\n## Format example\n\n---\n## Required Python third-party packages\n```python\n"""\nflask==1.1.2\nbcrypt==3.2.0\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages\n```python\n"""\nNo third-party ...\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec\n```python\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\n...\ndescription: A JSON object ...\n"""\n```\n\n## Logic Analysis\n```python\n[\n    ("game.py", "Contains ..."),\n]\n```\n\n## Task list\n```python\n[\n    "game.py",\n]\n```\n\n## Shared Knowledge\n```python\n"""\n\'game.py\' contains ...\n"""\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nWe need ... how to start.\n---\n\n-----\nRole: You are a project manager; the goal is to break down tasks according to PRD/technical design, give a task list, and analyze task dependencies to start with the prerequisite modules\nRequirements: Based on the context, fill in the following missing information, note that all sections are returned in Python code triple quote form seperatedly.

It should have a user-friendly interface and provide various difficulty levels for the puzzles. Users should be able to start a new game, input numbers into the grid, check if their solution is correct, get hints when they\'re stuck, and change the difficulty level.\n\n## Requirement Pool\n```python\n[\n    ("End game screen with score and time", "P0"),\n    ("Ability to save and load game progress", "P1"),\n    ("Option to highlight incorrect numbers", "P1"),\n    ("Timer to track the time taken to solve the puzzle", "P2"),\n    ("Option to undo and redo moves", "P2")\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft\nThe UI should have a grid layout to display the sudoku puzzle. Each cell in the grid should be clickable to allow the user to input numbers. The UI should also have buttons for starting a new game, checking the solution, getting hints, and changing the difficulty level. The design should be clean and minimalistic, with a soothing color scheme.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nFor implementing the sudoku game using pygame, we will use the following open-source tools:\n\n1. Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.\n\n2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.\n\n5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality. We can use it to display text elements such as hints, messages, and scores in the game.\n\nBy using these open-source tools, we can leverage the existing functionality and resources available in the community to build a robust and feature-rich sudoku game.\n\n## Python package name\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n    "game.py",\n    "grid.py",\n    "cell.py",\n    "solver.py",\n    "menu.py",\n    "text.py",\n    "assets/",\n    "fonts/",\n    "images/"\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Game{\n        -int score\n        -int time\n        -Grid grid\n        -Solver solver\n        +start_new_game(difficulty: str) -> None\n        +input_number(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +check_solution() -> bool\n        +get_hint() -> Tuple[int, int, int]\n        +change_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Grid{\n        -List[List[Cell]] cells\n        +get_cell(row: int, col: int) -> Cell\n        +is_valid_move(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> bool\n        +is_complete() -> bool\n    }\n    class Cell{\n        -int value\n        -bool editable\n        +get_value() -> int\n        +set_value(value: int) -> None\n        +is_editable() -> bool\n    }\n    class Solver{\n        -Grid grid\n        +solve() -> bool\n    }\n    class Menu{\n        -List[str] difficulty_levels\n        +get_difficulty_levels() -> List[str]\n        +set_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Text{\n        -str text\n        -int size\n        -str color\n        -str font\n        +render() -> pygame.Surface\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "1" Grid: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Solver: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Menu: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Text: has\n    Grid "1" -- "*" Cell: contains\n    Menu "1" -- "*" Text: contains\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant GD as Grid\n    participant C as Cell\n    participant S as Solver\n    participant MN as Menu\n    participant T as Text\n    ...\n    M->>G: start new game\n    G->>MN: get difficulty levels\n    MN->>M: return difficulty levels\n    M->>G: set difficulty\n    G->>GD: create grid\n    GD->>C: create cells\n    G->>S: create solver\n    M->>G: input number\n    G->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: set value\n    M->>G: check solution\n    G->>GD: is complete\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: get hint\n    G->>S: solve\n    S->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: change difficulty\n    G->>MN: set difficulty\n    M->>G: end game\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirements are clear to me., Project Manager: ## Required Python third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\npygame==2.0.1\npygame_gui==0.6.6\npygame-menu==4.0.5\npygame-menu-selection==1.0.2\npygame-text==0.1.0\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\nNo other language third-party packages required.\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec:\n```python\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: Sudoku Game API\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths:\n  /game/start:\n    post:\n      summary: Start a new game\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                difficulty:\n                  type: string\n                  enum: [easy, medium, hard]\n              required:\n                -

It should have a user-friendly interface and provide various difficulty levels for the puzzles. Users should be able to start a new game, input numbers into the grid, check if their solution is correct, get hints when they\'re stuck, and change the difficulty level.\n\n## Requirement Pool\n```python\n[\n    ("End game screen with score and time", "P0"),\n    ("Ability to save and load game progress", "P1"),\n    ("Option to highlight incorrect numbers", "P1"),\n    ("Timer to track the time taken to solve the puzzle", "P2"),\n    ("Option to undo and redo moves", "P2")\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft\nThe UI should have a grid layout to display the sudoku puzzle. Each cell in the grid should be clickable to allow the user to input numbers. The UI should also have buttons for starting a new game, checking the solution, getting hints, and changing the difficulty level. The design should be clean and minimalistic, with a soothing color scheme.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nFor implementing the sudoku game using pygame, we will use the following open-source tools:\n\n1. Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.\n\n2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.\n\n5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality. We can use it to display text elements such as hints, messages, and scores in the game.\n\nBy using these open-source tools, we can leverage the existing functionality and resources available in the community to build a robust and feature-rich sudoku game.\n\n## Python package name\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n    "game.py",\n    "grid.py",\n    "cell.py",\n    "solver.py",\n    "menu.py",\n    "text.py",\n    "assets/",\n    "fonts/",\n    "images/"\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Game{\n        -int score\n        -int time\n        -Grid grid\n        -Solver solver\n        +start_new_game(difficulty: str) -> None\n        +input_number(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +check_solution() -> bool\n        +get_hint() -> Tuple[int, int, int]\n        +change_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Grid{\n        -List[List[Cell]] cells\n        +get_cell(row: int, col: int) -> Cell\n        +is_valid_move(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> bool\n        +is_complete() -> bool\n    }\n    class Cell{\n        -int value\n        -bool editable\n        +get_value() -> int\n        +set_value(value: int) -> None\n        +is_editable() -> bool\n    }\n    class Solver{\n        -Grid grid\n        +solve() -> bool\n    }\n    class Menu{\n        -List[str] difficulty_levels\n        +get_difficulty_levels() -> List[str]\n        +set_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Text{\n        -str text\n        -int size\n        -str color\n        -str font\n        +render() -> pygame.Surface\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "1" Grid: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Solver: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Menu: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Text: has\n    Grid "1" -- "*" Cell: contains\n    Menu "1" -- "*" Text: contains\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant GD as Grid\n    participant C as Cell\n    participant S as Solver\n    participant MN as Menu\n    participant T as Text\n    ...\n    M->>G: start new game\n    G->>MN: get difficulty levels\n    MN->>M: return difficulty levels\n    M->>G: set difficulty\n    G->>GD: create grid\n    GD->>C: create cells\n    G->>S: create solver\n    M->>G: input number\n    G->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: set value\n    M->>G: check solution\n    G->>GD: is complete\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: get hint\n    G->>S: solve\n    S->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: change difficulty\n    G->>MN: set difficulty\n    M->>G: end game\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirements are clear to me., Project Manager: ## Required Python third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\npygame==2.0.1\npygame_gui==0.6.6\npygame-menu==4.0.5\npygame-menu-selection==1.0.2\npygame-text==0.1.0\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\nNo other language third-party packages required.\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec:\n```python\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: Sudoku Game API\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths:\n  /game/start:\n    post:\n      summary: Start a new game\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                difficulty:\n                  type: string\n                  enum: [easy, medium, hard]\n              required:\n                -

Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.\n\n2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.\n\n5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality. We can use it to display text elements such as hints, messages, and scores in the game.\n\nBy using these open-source tools, we can leverage the existing functionality and resources available in the community to build a robust and feature-rich sudoku game.\n\n## Python package name\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n    "game.py",\n    "grid.py",\n    "cell.py",\n    "solver.py",\n    "menu.py",\n    "text.py",\n    "assets/",\n    "fonts/",\n    "images/"\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Game{\n        -int score\n        -int time\n        -Grid grid\n        -Solver solver\n        +start_new_game(difficulty: str) -> None\n        +input_number(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +check_solution() -> bool\n        +get_hint() -> Tuple[int, int, int]\n        +change_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Grid{\n        -List[List[Cell]] cells\n        +get_cell(row: int, col: int) -> Cell\n        +is_valid_move(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> bool\n        +is_complete() -> bool\n    }\n    class Cell{\n        -int value\n        -bool editable\n        +get_value() -> int\n        +set_value(value: int) -> None\n        +is_editable() -> bool\n    }\n    class Solver{\n        -Grid grid\n        +solve() -> bool\n    }\n    class Menu{\n        -List[str] difficulty_levels\n        +get_difficulty_levels() -> List[str]\n        +set_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Text{\n        -str text\n        -int size\n        -str color\n        -str font\n        +render() -> pygame.Surface\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "1" Grid: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Solver: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Menu: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Text: has\n    Grid "1" -- "*" Cell: contains\n    Menu "1" -- "*" Text: contains\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant GD as Grid\n    participant C as Cell\n    participant S as Solver\n    participant MN as Menu\n    participant T as Text\n    ...\n    M->>G: start new game\n    G->>MN: get difficulty levels\n    MN->>M: return difficulty levels\n    M->>G: set difficulty\n    G->>GD: create grid\n    GD->>C: create cells\n    G->>S: create solver\n    M->>G: input number\n    G->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: set value\n    M->>G: check solution\n    G->>GD: is complete\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: get hint\n    G->>S: solve\n    S->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: change difficulty\n    G->>MN: set difficulty\n    M->>G: end game\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirements are clear to me.\n## Required Python third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\npygame==2.0.1\npygame_gui==0.6.6\npygame-menu==4.0.5\npygame-menu-selection==1.0.2\npygame-text==0.1.0\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\nNo other language third-party packages required.\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec:\n```python\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: Sudoku Game API\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths:\n  /game/start:\n    post:\n      summary: Start a new game\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                difficulty:\n                  type: string\n                  enum: [easy, medium, hard]\n              required:\n                -

Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.\n\n2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.\n\n5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality.

Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.\n\n2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.\n\n5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality. We can use it to display text elements such as hints, messages, and scores in the game.\n\nBy using these open-source tools, we can leverage the existing functionality and resources available in the community to build a robust and feature-rich sudoku game.\n\n## Python package name\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n    "game.py",\n    "grid.py",\n    "cell.py",\n    "solver.py",\n    "menu.py",\n    "text.py",\n    "assets/",\n    "fonts/",\n    "images/"\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Game{\n        -int score\n        -int time\n        -Grid grid\n        -Solver solver\n        +start_new_game(difficulty: str) -> None\n        +input_number(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +check_solution() -> bool\n        +get_hint() -> Tuple[int, int, int]\n        +change_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Grid{\n        -List[List[Cell]] cells\n        +get_cell(row: int, col: int) -> Cell\n        +is_valid_move(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> bool\n        +is_complete() -> bool\n    }\n    class Cell{\n        -int value\n        -bool editable\n        +get_value() -> int\n        +set_value(value: int) -> None\n        +is_editable() -> bool\n    }\n    class Solver{\n        -Grid grid\n        +solve() -> bool\n    }\n    class Menu{\n        -List[str] difficulty_levels\n        +get_difficulty_levels() -> List[str]\n        +set_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Text{\n        -str text\n        -int size\n        -str color\n        -str font\n        +render() -> pygame.Surface\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "1" Grid: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Solver: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Menu: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Text: has\n    Grid "1" -- "*" Cell: contains\n    Menu "1" -- "*" Text: contains\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant GD as Grid\n    participant C as Cell\n    participant S as Solver\n    participant MN as Menu\n    participant T as Text\n    ...\n    M->>G: start new game\n    G->>MN: get difficulty levels\n    MN->>M: return difficulty levels\n    M->>G: set difficulty\n    G->>GD: create grid\n    GD->>C: create cells\n    G->>S: create solver\n    M->>G: input number\n    G->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: set value\n    M->>G: check solution\n    G->>GD: is complete\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: get hint\n    G->>S: solve\n    S->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: change difficulty\n    G->>MN: set difficulty\n    M->>G: end game\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirements are clear to me.\n## Required Python third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\npygame==2.0.1\npygame_gui==0.6.6\npygame-menu==4.0.5\npygame-menu-selection==1.0.2\npygame-text==0.1.0\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\nNo other language third-party packages required.\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec:\n```python\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: Sudoku Game API\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths:\n  /game/start:\n    post:\n      summary: Start a new game\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                difficulty:\n                  type: string\n                  enum: [easy, medium, hard]\n              required:\n                -

Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.\n\n2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.\n\n5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality. We can use it to display text elements such as hints, messages, and scores in the game.\n\nBy using these open-source tools, we can leverage the existing functionality and resources available in the community to build a robust and feature-rich sudoku game.\n\n## Python package name\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n    "game.py",\n    "grid.py",\n    "cell.py",\n    "solver.py",\n    "menu.py",\n    "text.py",\n    "assets/",\n    "fonts/",\n    "images/"\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Game{\n        -int score\n        -int time\n        -Grid grid\n        -Solver solver\n        +start_new_game(difficulty: str) -> None\n        +input_number(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +check_solution() -> bool\n        +get_hint() -> Tuple[int, int, int]\n        +change_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Grid{\n        -List[List[Cell]] cells\n        +get_cell(row: int, col: int) -> Cell\n        +is_valid_move(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> bool\n        +is_complete() -> bool\n    }\n    class Cell{\n        -int value\n        -bool editable\n        +get_value() -> int\n        +set_value(value: int) -> None\n        +is_editable() -> bool\n    }\n    class Solver{\n        -Grid grid\n        +solve() -> bool\n    }\n    class Menu{\n        -List[str] difficulty_levels\n        +get_difficulty_levels() -> List[str]\n        +set_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Text{\n        -str text\n        -int size\n        -str color\n        -str font\n        +render() -> pygame.Surface\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "1" Grid: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Solver: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Menu: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Text: has\n    Grid "1" -- "*" Cell: contains\n    Menu "1" -- "*" Text: contains\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant GD as Grid\n    participant C as Cell\n    participant S as Solver\n    participant MN as Menu\n    participant T as Text\n    ...\n    M->>G: start new game\n    G->>MN: get difficulty levels\n    MN->>M: return difficulty levels\n    M->>G: set difficulty\n    G->>GD: create grid\n    GD->>C: create cells\n    G->>S: create solver\n    M->>G: input number\n    G->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: set value\n    M->>G: check solution\n    G->>GD: is complete\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: get hint\n    G->>S: solve\n    S->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: change difficulty\n    G->>MN: set difficulty\n    M->>G: end game\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirements are clear to me.\n## Required Python third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\npygame==2.0.1\npygame_gui==0.6.6\npygame-menu==4.0.5\npygame-menu-selection==1.0.2\npygame-text==0.1.0\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\nNo other language third-party packages required.\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec:\n```python\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: Sudoku Game API\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths:\n  /game/start:\n    post:\n      summary: Start a new game\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                difficulty:\n                  type: string\n                  enum: [easy, medium, hard]\n              required:\n                -

Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.\n\n2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders.

Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.\n\n2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.\n\n5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality.

Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.\n\n2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.\n\n5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality.

Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.\n\n2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.\n\n5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality. We can use it to display text elements such as hints, messages, and scores in the game.\n\nBy using these open-source tools, we can leverage the existing functionality and resources available in the community to build a robust and feature-rich sudoku game.\n\n## Python package name\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n    "game.py",\n    "grid.py",\n    "cell.py",\n    "solver.py",\n    "menu.py",\n    "text.py",\n    "assets/",\n    "fonts/",\n    "images/"\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Game{\n        -int score\n        -int time\n        -Grid grid\n        -Solver solver\n        +start_new_game(difficulty: str) -> None\n        +input_number(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +check_solution() -> bool\n        +get_hint() -> Tuple[int, int, int]\n        +change_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Grid{\n        -List[List[Cell]] cells\n        +get_cell(row: int, col: int) -> Cell\n        +is_valid_move(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> bool\n        +is_complete() -> bool\n    }\n    class Cell{\n        -int value\n        -bool editable\n        +get_value() -> int\n        +set_value(value: int) -> None\n        +is_editable() -> bool\n    }\n    class Solver{\n        -Grid grid\n        +solve() -> bool\n    }\n    class Menu{\n        -List[str] difficulty_levels\n        +get_difficulty_levels() -> List[str]\n        +set_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Text{\n        -str text\n        -int size\n        -str color\n        -str font\n        +render() -> pygame.Surface\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "1" Grid: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Solver: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Menu: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Text: has\n    Grid "1" -- "*" Cell: contains\n    Menu "1" -- "*" Text: contains\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant GD as Grid\n    participant C as Cell\n    participant S as Solver\n    participant MN as Menu\n    participant T as Text\n    ...\n    M->>G: start new game\n    G->>MN: get difficulty levels\n    MN->>M: return difficulty levels\n    M->>G: set difficulty\n    G->>GD: create grid\n    GD->>C: create cells\n    G->>S: create solver\n    M->>G: input number\n    G->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: set value\n    M->>G: check solution\n    G->>GD: is complete\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: get hint\n    G->>S: solve\n    S->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: change difficulty\n    G->>MN: set difficulty\n    M->>G: end game\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirements are clear to me.\n## Required Python third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\npygame==2.0.1\npygame_gui==0.6.6\npygame-menu==4.0.5\npygame-menu-selection==1.0.2\npygame-text==0.1.0\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\nNo other language third-party packages required.\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec:\n```python\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: Sudoku Game API\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths:\n  /game/start:\n    post:\n      summary: Start a new game\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                difficulty:\n                  type: string\n                  enum: [easy, medium, hard]\n              required:\n                -

Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.\n\n2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.\n\n5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality.

Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.\n\n2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.\n\n5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality. We can use it to display text elements such as hints, messages, and scores in the game.\n\nBy using these open-source tools, we can leverage the existing functionality and resources available in the community to build a robust and feature-rich sudoku game.\n\n## Python package name\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n    "game.py",\n    "grid.py",\n    "cell.py",\n    "solver.py",\n    "menu.py",\n    "text.py",\n    "assets/",\n    "fonts/",\n    "images/"\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Game{\n        -int score\n        -int time\n        -Grid grid\n        -Solver solver\n        +start_new_game(difficulty: str) -> None\n        +input_number(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +check_solution() -> bool\n        +get_hint() -> Tuple[int, int, int]\n        +change_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Grid{\n        -List[List[Cell]] cells\n        +get_cell(row: int, col: int) -> Cell\n        +is_valid_move(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> bool\n        +is_complete() -> bool\n    }\n    class Cell{\n        -int value\n        -bool editable\n        +get_value() -> int\n        +set_value(value: int) -> None\n        +is_editable() -> bool\n    }\n    class Solver{\n        -Grid grid\n        +solve() -> bool\n    }\n    class Menu{\n        -List[str] difficulty_levels\n        +get_difficulty_levels() -> List[str]\n        +set_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Text{\n        -str text\n        -int size\n        -str color\n        -str font\n        +render() -> pygame.Surface\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "1" Grid: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Solver: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Menu: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Text: has\n    Grid "1" -- "*" Cell: contains\n    Menu "1" -- "*" Text: contains\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant GD as Grid\n    participant C as Cell\n    participant S as Solver\n    participant MN as Menu\n    participant T as Text\n    ...\n    M->>G: start new game\n    G->>MN: get difficulty levels\n    MN->>M: return difficulty levels\n    M->>G: set difficulty\n    G->>GD: create grid\n    GD->>C: create cells\n    G->>S: create solver\n    M->>G: input number\n    G->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: set value\n    M->>G: check solution\n    G->>GD: is complete\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: get hint\n    G->>S: solve\n    S->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: change difficulty\n    G->>MN: set difficulty\n    M->>G: end game\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirements are clear to me.\n## Required Python third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\npygame==2.0.1\npygame_gui==0.6.6\npygame-menu==4.0.5\npygame-menu-selection==1.0.2\npygame-text==0.1.0\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\nNo other language third-party packages required.\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec:\n```python\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: Sudoku Game API\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths:\n  /game/start:\n    post:\n      summary: Start a new game\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                difficulty:\n                  type: string\n                  enum: [easy, medium, hard]\n              required:\n                -

DONT CHANGE ANY DESIGN.\n5. Think before writing: What should be implemented and provided in this document?\n6. CAREFULLY CHECK THAT YOU DONT MISS ANY NECESSARY CLASS/FUNCTION IN THIS FILE.\n7. Do not use public member functions that do not exist in your design.\n\n-----\n# Context\n## Implementation approach\nFor implementing the sudoku game using pygame, we will use the following open-source tools:\n\n1. Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.\n\n2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.\n\n5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality. We can use it to display text elements such as hints, messages, and scores in the game.\n\nBy using these open-source tools, we can leverage the existing functionality and resources available in the community to build a robust and feature-rich sudoku game.\n\n## Python package name\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n    "game.py",\n    "grid.py",\n    "cell.py",\n    "solver.py",\n    "menu.py",\n    "text.py",\n    "assets/",\n    "fonts/",\n    "images/"\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Game{\n        -int score\n        -int time\n        -Grid grid\n        -Solver solver\n        +start_new_game(difficulty: str) -> None\n        +input_number(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +check_solution() -> bool\n        +get_hint() -> Tuple[int, int, int]\n        +change_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Grid{\n        -List[List[Cell]] cells\n        +get_cell(row: int, col: int) -> Cell\n        +is_valid_move(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> bool\n        +is_complete() -> bool\n    }\n    class Cell{\n        -int value\n        -bool editable\n        +get_value() -> int\n        +set_value(value: int) -> None\n        +is_editable() -> bool\n    }\n    class Solver{\n        -Grid grid\n        +solve() -> bool\n    }\n    class Menu{\n        -List[str] difficulty_levels\n        +get_difficulty_levels() -> List[str]\n        +set_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Text{\n        -str text\n        -int size\n        -str color\n        -str font\n        +render() -> pygame.Surface\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "1" Grid: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Solver: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Menu: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Text: has\n    Grid "1" -- "*" Cell: contains\n    Menu "1" -- "*" Text: contains\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant GD as Grid\n    participant C as Cell\n    participant S as Solver\n    participant MN as Menu\n    participant T as Text\n    ...\n    M->>G: start new game\n    G->>MN: get difficulty levels\n    MN->>M: return difficulty levels\n    M->>G: set difficulty\n    G->>GD: create grid\n    GD->>C: create cells\n    G->>S: create solver\n    M->>G: input number\n    G->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: set value\n    M->>G: check solution\n    G->>GD: is complete\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: get hint\n    G->>S: solve\n    S->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: change difficulty\n    G->>MN: set difficulty\n    M->>G: end game\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirements are clear to me.\n## Required Python third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\npygame==2.0.1\npygame_gui==0.6.6\npygame-menu==4.0.5\npygame-menu-selection==1.0.2\npygame-text==0.1.0\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\nNo other language third-party packages required.\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec:\n```python\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: Sudoku Game API\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths:\n  /game/start:\n    post:\n      summary: Start a new game\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                difficulty:\n                  type: string\n                  enum: [easy, medium, hard]\n              required:\n                -

Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.\n\n3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.\n\n4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.\n\n5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality. We can use it to display text elements such as hints, messages, and scores in the game.\n\nBy using these open-source tools, we can leverage the existing functionality and resources available in the community to build a robust and feature-rich sudoku game.\n\n## Python package name\n```python\n"sudoku_game"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n    "game.py",\n    "grid.py",\n    "cell.py",\n    "solver.py",\n    "menu.py",\n    "text.py",\n    "assets/",\n    "fonts/",\n    "images/"\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Game{\n        -int score\n        -int time\n        -Grid grid\n        -Solver solver\n        +start_new_game(difficulty: str) -> None\n        +input_number(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None\n        +check_solution() -> bool\n        +get_hint() -> Tuple[int, int, int]\n        +change_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Grid{\n        -List[List[Cell]] cells\n        +get_cell(row: int, col: int) -> Cell\n        +is_valid_move(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> bool\n        +is_complete() -> bool\n    }\n    class Cell{\n        -int value\n        -bool editable\n        +get_value() -> int\n        +set_value(value: int) -> None\n        +is_editable() -> bool\n    }\n    class Solver{\n        -Grid grid\n        +solve() -> bool\n    }\n    class Menu{\n        -List[str] difficulty_levels\n        +get_difficulty_levels() -> List[str]\n        +set_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None\n    }\n    class Text{\n        -str text\n        -int size\n        -str color\n        -str font\n        +render() -> pygame.Surface\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "1" Grid: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Solver: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Menu: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Text: has\n    Grid "1" -- "*" Cell: contains\n    Menu "1" -- "*" Text: contains\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant GD as Grid\n    participant C as Cell\n    participant S as Solver\n    participant MN as Menu\n    participant T as Text\n    ...\n    M->>G: start new game\n    G->>MN: get difficulty levels\n    MN->>M: return difficulty levels\n    M->>G: set difficulty\n    G->>GD: create grid\n    GD->>C: create cells\n    G->>S: create solver\n    M->>G: input number\n    G->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: set value\n    M->>G: check solution\n    G->>GD: is complete\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: get hint\n    G->>S: solve\n    S->>GD: get cell\n    GD->>C: get value\n    M->>G: change difficulty\n    G->>MN: set difficulty\n    M->>G: end game\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirements are clear to me.\n## Required Python third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\npygame==2.0.1\npygame_gui==0.6.6\npygame-menu==4.0.5\npygame-menu-selection==1.0.2\npygame-text==0.1.0\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages:\n```python\n"""\nNo other language third-party packages required.\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec:\n```python\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: Sudoku Game API\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths:\n  /game/start:\n    post:\n      summary: Start a new game\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                difficulty:\n                  type: string\n                  enum: [easy, medium, hard]\n              required:\n                -
