## Implementation approach
For implementing the sudoku game using pygame, we will use the following open-source tools:

1. Pygame: A popular open-source library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python. It provides functionality for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering graphics.

2. Pygame_gui: An open-source GUI library for pygame that provides a set of pre-built UI elements and tools for creating user interfaces. It will help us create the user-friendly interface for the sudoku game.

3. Pygame-menu: Another open-source library for pygame that provides a menu system for creating menus and submenus in pygame applications. We can use it to create menus for starting a new game, changing difficulty levels, and other options.

4. Pygame-Menu-Selection: An open-source library that extends pygame-menu and provides additional features such as selection menus, checkboxes, and sliders. It can be used to enhance the user interface and provide more interactive options.

5. Pygame-Text: An open-source library for pygame that provides text rendering functionality. We can use it to display text elements such as hints, messages, and scores in the game.

By using these open-source tools, we can leverage the existing functionality and resources available in the community to build a robust and feature-rich sudoku game.

    class Game{
        -int score
        -int time
        -Grid grid
        -Solver solver
        +start_new_game(difficulty: str) -> None
        +input_number(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> None
        +check_solution() -> bool
        +get_hint() -> Tuple[int, int, int]
        +change_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None
    }
    class Grid{
        -List[List[Cell]] cells
        +get_cell(row: int, col: int) -> Cell
        +is_valid_move(row: int, col: int, number: int) -> bool
        +is_complete() -> bool
    }
    class Cell{
        -int value
        -bool editable
        +get_value() -> int
        +set_value(value: int) -> None
        +is_editable() -> bool
    }
    class Solver{
        -Grid grid
        +solve() -> bool
    }
    class Menu{
        -List[str] difficulty_levels
        +get_difficulty_levels() -> List[str]
        +set_difficulty(difficulty: str) -> None
    }
    class Text{
        -str text
        -int size
        -str color
        -str font
        +render() -> pygame.Surface
    }
    Game "1" -- "1" Grid: has
    Game "1" -- "1" Solver: has
    Game "1" -- "1" Menu: has
    Game "1" -- "1" Text: has
    Grid "1" -- "*" Cell: contains
    Menu "1" -- "*" Text: contains
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant GD as Grid
    participant C as Cell
    participant S as Solver
    participant MN as Menu
    participant T as Text
    ...
    M->>G: start new game
    G->>MN: get difficulty levels
    MN->>M: return difficulty levels
    M->>G: set difficulty
    G->>GD: create grid
    GD->>C: create cells
    G->>S: create solver
    M->>G: input number
    G->>GD: get cell
    GD->>C: set value
    M->>G: check solution
    G->>GD: is complete
    GD->>C: get value
    M->>G: get hint
    G->>S: solve
    S->>GD: get cell
    GD->>C: get value
    M->>G: change difficulty
    G->>MN: set difficulty
    M->>G: end game
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirements are clear to me.
