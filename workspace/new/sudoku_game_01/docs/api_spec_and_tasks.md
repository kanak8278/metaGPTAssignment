## Shared Knowledge:
```python
"""
The 'game.py' file contains the Game class which is responsible for managing the game logic. It has methods for starting a new game, inputting numbers in the grid, checking the solution, getting hints, and changing the difficulty level.

The 'grid.py' file contains the Grid class which represents the sudoku grid. It has methods for getting cells, checking if a move is valid, and checking if the grid is complete.

The 'cell.py' file contains the Cell class which represents individual cells in the grid. It has methods for getting and setting the cell value, and checking if the cell is editable.

The 'solver.py' file contains the Solver class which is responsible for solving the sudoku grid. It has a method for solving the grid.

The 'menu.py' file contains the Menu class which manages the game menu. It has methods for getting difficulty levels and setting the difficulty.

The 'text.py' file contains the Text class which is responsible for rendering text elements in the game. It has a method for rendering text.

The 'assets/' directory is used for storing game assets such as fonts and images.

The 'fonts/' directory is used for storing game fonts.
