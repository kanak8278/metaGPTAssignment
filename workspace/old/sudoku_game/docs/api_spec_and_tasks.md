## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Main"),
    ("game.py", "Game"),
    ("grid.py", "Grid"),
    ("solver.py", "Solver"),
    ("ui.py", "UI"),
    ("puzzles.py", "Puzzles")
]
```

The task dependencies are as follows:
1. `puzzles.py` should be implemented first as it is used by `game.py` to generate puzzles.
2. `grid.py` should be implemented next as it is used by `game.py` and `ui.py` to manipulate and display the grid.
3. `solver.py` should be implemented next as it is used by `game.py` to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
4. `ui.py` should be implemented next as it is used by `game.py` to interact with the user and display the game interface.
5. `game.py` should be implemented last as it is the main module that ties all the other modules together and implements the game logic.

## Task list:

```python
[
    "puzzles.py",
    "grid.py",
    "solver.py",
    "ui.py",
    "game.py"
]
