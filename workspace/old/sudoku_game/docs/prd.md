## Requirement Analysis:
The product should be a sudoku game implemented using the pygame library. It should allow users to start a new game, input numbers into the sudoku grid, check the correctness of their solution, receive hints or suggestions, and save/load their progress. The game should have varying difficulty levels to cater to different users.

## Requirement Pool:
```python
[
    ("Implement game logic for generating random sudoku puzzles", "P0"),
    ("Implement user interface for displaying the sudoku grid", "P0"),
    ("Implement user input functionality for entering numbers into the grid", "P0"),
    ("Implement game logic for checking the correctness of the solution", "P0"),
    ("Implement hint/suggestion functionality to assist users", "P1")
]
```

## UI Design draft:
The UI design will consist of a grid layout representing the sudoku puzzle. Each cell in the grid will be editable and allow users to input numbers. The UI will also include buttons for starting a new game, checking the solution, receiving hints, and saving/loading progress. The design will be clean and minimalistic, with clear labels and intuitive controls.

## Anything UNCLEAR:
There are no unclear points.
